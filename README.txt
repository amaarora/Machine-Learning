3. Linear Discriminant Analysis 
4. Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
5. Support Vector Machines
6. Random Forrest
7. Decision Trees
8. KNN
9. Boosting 
10. Bagging 
11. Undersampling, Oversampling, SMOTE 
12. Splines - Natural, Cubic, Polynomial 
13. Cross Validation 
14. k-fold Cross Validation 
15. Ridge Regression 
16. Lasso Regression 
17. Polynomial Regression

*I have keen interest in understanding the Mathematics behind the models 
*My favourite lecture "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PwhiWxHK8o&t=2645s" on Support Vector Machines 
*Data Science really excites me (not because it is the sexiest job of the century)

What I do not know well and are on my list of things to Learn in immediate future: 
1. Nueral Nets
2. Deep Learning 
3. Working on Big Data using Spark
4. Proficient Application of all concepts that I know in Theory using Python (I need to skill up in Python) 
5. Conveying stories using Tableau 
6. "R" for statistical models: some models are easier to implement in R as compared to Python Sklearn
7. Read "CLEAN CODE" book 
8. Get more proficient and smart at coding
