I have undertaken General Assembly Data Science course and participated in Several Kaggle Competitions as part of my self-learning. I am very well versed with Machine Learning Models including both regressors and classifiers. 

I have used the following ML models or their combinations and understand the implementation and mathematics behind these models very well. 
Linear Regression, Logical Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machines, Random Forrest, Decision Trees, KNN, Boosting, Bagging, Undersampling, Oversampling, SMOTE, Splines - Natural, Cubic, Polynomial, Cross Validation, k-fold Cross Validation, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Polynomial Regression, Smoothing Splines, Decision Tree Regressor, Model Stacking, OnoVsOne, OneVsRest, Multi Class Evaluation Metrics..
