MACHINE LEARNING:
Read “Elements of Statistical Learning” by Jerome H. Friedman, Robert Tibshirani, and Trevor Hastie
https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf

PYTHON:
“Introduction to Computation and Programming using Python” an MIT Pressbook by John V Guttag available at https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-computation-and-programming-using-python-second-edition (in-progress)

HERE’s WHAT MY PAST 3 MONTHS LOOK LIKE:
PAST PROJECTS:
- Imbalance Datasets - “Predicting Congenital Disorder” available at https://github.com/arora-aman123/Data_Science_Projects/tree/master/02.Predicting%20Rare%20Desease
- Multi-Class Classification - “Predicting Employee Satisfaction using Government Data Set” available at https://github.com/arora-aman123/Data_Science_Projects/tree/master/03.Predicting%20Employee%20Satisfaction%20using%20GOV%20data
- Predicting AIRBNB HousePrice (Regression) 
https://github.com/arora-aman123/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/AIRBNB.ipynb

I read articles on Dataquest, TowardsDataScience, Kaggle(Tutorial), KDNuggets.. on a daily basis and try to learn new concepts every day. 
Now I am taking up Deep Learning, Big Data, Machine Learning and Python courses online after completing “Introduction to Data Science” from General Assembly.  

PRACTICAL PROJECT: (Coming Soon) 
https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk

BOOKS:
- Introduction to Statistical Learning 
- ThinkStats
- Introduction to Machine Learning using Python

* I have keen interest in understanding the Mathematics behind the models 
* My favourite lecture "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PwhiWxHK8o&t=2645s" on Support Vector Machines 
* Data Science really excites me (not just because it is the sexiest job of the century)

LIMITATIONS:
I have little knowledge of GIT/GITHUB. I have not worked in a team environment before and do not know how to solve conflicts or related issues when working in a team environment. Happy to learn once I start working on a project with fellow Data Scientists.
