I read articles on Dataquest, TowardsDataScience, Kaggle(Tutorial), KDNuggets.. on a daily and try to learn new concepts every day. 

Current Project that I am working on:
‘MultiClass Classification’ - Predicting Employee Satisfaction using Government DataSet


I have read and completed ‘Introduction to Statistical Learning’.

Next on my List:
1. Introduction to Machine Learning with Python (In Progress) 
2. Elements of Statistical Learning (Next)

My knowledge base so far(needs more building on top): 
1. Linear Regression
2. Logical Regression
3. Linear Discriminant Analysis 
4. Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
5. Support Vector Machines
6. Random Forrest
7. Decision Trees
8. KNN
9. Boosting 
10. Bagging 
11. Undersampling, Oversampling, SMOTE 
12. Splines - Natural, Cubic, Polynomial 
13. Cross Validation 
14. k-fold Cross Validation 
15. Ridge Regression 
16. Lasso Regression 
17. Polynomial Regression 
18. Smoothing Splines 
19. Decision Tree Regressor 
20. Model Stacking 

*I have keen interest in understanding the Mathematics behind the models 
*My favourite lecture "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PwhiWxHK8o&t=2645s" on Support Vector Machines 
*Data Science really excites me (not because it is the sexiest job of the century)

What I do not know well and are on my list of things to Learn in immediate future: 
1. Neural Nets
2. Deep Learning 
3. Working on Big Data using Spark, HIVE, Hadoop (depending on Requirement
4. Application of all concepts that I know in Theory using Python (I need to skill up in Python) 
5. Conveying stories using Tableau
6. "R" for statistical models: some models are easier to implement in R as compared to Python Sklearn
7. Read "CLEAN CODE" book 

I have little knowledge of GIT/GITHUB. I have not worked in a team environment before and am not aware of 
how to solve conflicts or related issues when working in a team
