    "**About the data:** In accordance with section 22D of the Public Sector Management Act 1994, the Public Sector Commissioner reports annually to Parliament on the state of public sector administration and management, and on the extent of compliance with public sector standards and ethical codes. One of the primary information sources used for the State of the WA public sector report 2015 - Creating opportunities is the employee perception survey (EPS). <br> \n",
    "The EPS captures employee views about factors affecting their workplace, such as leadership, communication, work/life balance and performance development. This information helps to understand organisational culture across the public sector and is essential in identifying areas for further consideration and acknowledging good practice. <br>\n",
    "The EPS is typically conducted in each public sector body with more than 20 employees once every five years. Different regional offices for the largest agencies, Department of Health and Department of Education, are surveyed every year.\n",
